                Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Authored by Senators Burr and Edward Kennedy (D-MA), PAHPA created the framework for ensuring the federal government is prepared to respond to emerging health threats that could jeopardize our national security, whether that threat is from a naturally-occurring source like Ebola, or is man-made, such as a terrorist attack with a biological weapon.
